# Purpose of renaming files
Seeing the same song list over and over is incredibly boring. Well you can liven up your song list now by replacing a single word of each song name with a word of your choice!

# How to use
Place the .py inside your Stepmania or Etterna folder and run it. 


Follow the onscreen instructions.


You can edit words.txt with the text editor of your choice or edit it through the .py script


**DO NOT DELETE songBackup UNLESS YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO REVERT YOUR SONG NAMES IN THE FUTURE**


After finishing the process, **reload your songs/courses under the ingame stepmania/etterna options**.
